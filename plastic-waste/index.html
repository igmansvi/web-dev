                    <p class="heading">Plastic Waste</p>
                    <p>Plastic waste, or plastic pollution, is ‘the accumulation of plastic objects (e.g.: plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth’s environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans.</p>
                    <p>It also refers to the significant amount of plastic that isn’t recycled and ends up in landfill or, in the developing world, thrown into unregulated dump sites. In the UK, for example, over 5 million tonnes of plastic is consumed each year — and yet only 1 quarter of it is recycled.</p>

                                <p>&#x2022;Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that use polymers as a main ingredient.</p><br>
                            <p id="ques">But how it is harmful?</p>
                            <p id="ans"> Plastic sticks around in the environment for ages, threatening wildlife and spreading toxins. Plastic also contributes to global warming. Almost all plastics are made from chemicals that come from the production of planet-warming fuels (gas, oil and even coal).</p><br>
                            <p id="ques">Now! What is plastic waste?</p>
                            <p id="ans">Plastic Waste is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris.</p>
                            <p id="ques">What are the types effecting earth the most?</p>
                            <p id="ques">How can we reduce this plastic usage?</p>
                            <p id="ques">Why should we care about Plastic Waste?</p>
                            <p id="ans">There are many questions arises with this huge consumption of plastic.<br>
                                We are producing 380 millions tons of plastic every year and some reports indicates about more than 50% of that plastic is for 
                                single use purpose only! But for our planet it stays for more than several hundred years.
                            </p>
                            <p>Along with many normal use plastics, these single use-ones are the most harmful ones!
                                You can see some below:-
                            </p>
                            <img src="type.png" alt="Types of single use plastics"><br><hr>
                            <p>While plastic has many valuable uses, we have become addicted to single-use plastic products — with severe environmental, social, economic and health consequences.</p>
                                <p>Around the world, one million plastic bottles are purchased every minute, while up to five trillion plastic bags are used worldwide every year. In total, half of all plastic produced is designed for single-use purposes – used just once and then thrown away.</p>
                                <p>Plastics including microplastics are now ubiquitous in our natural environment. They are becoming part of the Earth's fossil record and a marker of the Anthropocene, our current geological era. They have even given their name to a new marine microbial habitat called the "plastisphere".</p>
                                <p id="ques">How did we get here?</p>
                                <p id="ans">Plastic production has sharply increased over the last 70 years. In 1950, the world produced just two million tonnes. It now produces over 450 million tonnes.<br>
                                 Plastic has added much value to our lives: it’s a cheap, versatile, and sterile material used in various applications, including construction, home appliances, medical instruments, and food packaging.<br>
                                 However, when plastic waste is mismanaged – not recycled, incinerated, or kept in sealed landfills – it becomes an environmental pollutant. One to two million tonnes of plastic enter our oceans yearly, affecting wildlife and ecosystems.</p>

                                        The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's seminal report, "The New Plastics Economy," marks a revolutionary stride toward a circular and regenerative approach to plastics. This visionary document charts a course away from the traditional linear "take, make, dispose" model, aiming to redefine our relationship with plastics on a global scale.
                                        At its core, the report advocates for a circular economy where plastics are designed for reuse, recycling, and regeneration. By urging businesses, governments, and innovators to collaborate, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation envisions a future where plastic waste is minimized, and materials circulate in closed loops.
                                        Key elements of the report include redesigning products to be more easily recyclable, investing in new technologies, and fostering cross-sector collaboration. The emphasis on systemic change and collaboration reflects a deep understanding of the intricate challenges posed by plastic pollution.
                                        "The New Plastics Economy" serves as a blueprint for a paradigm shift in the plastics industry. It challenges stakeholders to embrace innovation, adopt sustainable practices, and reimagine a future where plastics contribute positively to the global ecosystem.
                                        As society grapples with the urgency of addressing plastic waste, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's report stands as a guiding light, illuminating a transformative path towards a new era in plastics – one that prioritizes sustainability, circularity, and a harmonious coexistence with our planet.

                                        The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has unveiled a groundbreaking initiative with its report, "Single-Use Plastics: A Roadmap for Sustainability." This comprehensive guide serves as a critical tool in the global fight against the environmental menace of single-use plastics.
                                        The report, informed by extensive research and expert insights, provides a strategic framework for governments, businesses, and communities to navigate the complex challenge of plastic pollution. It emphasizes the urgency of addressing single-use plastics, offering a roadmap to sustainable alternatives and responsible consumption.
                                        Key highlights include a focus on policy interventions, industry innovations, and consumer behavior changes. The UNEP outlines the need for robust legislation, extended producer responsibility, and the promotion of circular economies to curb the production and disposal of single-use plastics.
                                        The roadmap underscores the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social aspects, advocating for a holistic approach to combat plastic pollution. By harnessing the power of international cooperation, the UNEP aims to inspire collective action, driving the world towards a future where single-use plastics are replaced with sustainable alternatives.
                                        In a world grappling with the consequences of plastic waste, the UNEP's roadmap emerges as a beacon of hope and guidance, offering tangible steps for a more sustainable and resilient future. It calls on individuals, businesses, and policymakers to unite in adopting the recommended strategies and turning the tide against the pervasive issue of single-use plastics.
